# Connecting Discord with Arduino

This project explores Discord's potential for Arduino management, demonstrating how Discord can be used to remotely control servo motors. All of this was done with the sole purpose of observing and analyzing the possibilities Discord offers and how it can be implemented with Arduino.

## Overview
The project involves controlling two servomotors connected to a 3D printer to move a platform in two axes. Discord serves as the interface for controlling these movements through a button matrix, triggered by the bot after using the '-movimiento' command.

## Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to thoroughly comment on each part of the code in English. I apologize in advance for any suboptimal practices; I'm a junior programmer eager to learn and improve.
